wRITE ME SOME PYTHON CODE
Sure, here's a simple Python code snippet that prints "Hello, World!":

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

Here's another example that calculates the sum of two numbers inputted by the user:

```python
# Get user input
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Calculate sum
sum = num1 + num2

# Print the result
print("Sum:", sum)
```

Let me know if there's anything more specific you'd like help with!

wRITE ME SOME PYTHON CODE
Certainly! Here are a few examples of Python code:

1. Hello World! Program:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

2. Simple Calculator:
```python
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

sum = num1 + num2
difference = num1 - num2
product = num1 * num2
quotient = num1 / num2

print("Sum:", sum)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Product:", product)
print("Quotient:", quotient)
```

3. Fibonacci Series:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_list = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    while len(fib_list) < n:
        fib_list.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return fib_list

# Example usage:
print(fibonacci(10))
```

4. Prime Number Checker:
```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage:
print(is_prime(17))  # Output: True
```

5. File Read and Write:
```python
# Writing to a file
with open("sample.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")

# Reading from a file
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

These are just a few examples to get you started. Python is a versatile programming language with many applications, so feel free to explore further!
